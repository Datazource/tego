# TeGo

Tego is a bunch of package to make creating microservice easier, if you expect something cool find Go Kit :

 * Json Config Loader (The current solution is not flexible enough, looking for toml as alternative)
 * Logger with multi output backend (TODO)
 * Context aware and graceful able transport for : (TODO)
   * Http service
   * GRPC service
 * Lightweight middleware implementation (TODO)
   * Common middleware implementation
 * Instrumentation support (TODO)
 * Use functional option

### The goal
The goal is to make integrated environment for creating microservice and sticking to the standard go package as much as possible, however using well known package is justified.
