# TeGo

Tego is a bunch of package to make creating microservice easier, if you expect something cool find Go Kit :

 * Json Config Loader
 * Logger with multi output backend (TODO)
 * Context aware server for : (TODO)
   * Simple http service
   * JSON service
   * Mixed content service
 * Lightweight middleware implementation (TODO)

### The goal
The goal is to make integrated environment for creating microservice and sticking to the standard go package as much as possible, however using well known package is justified.
